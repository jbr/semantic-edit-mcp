The goal of the tool is to make it easy to express small changes instead of having to rewrite the whole file, because many of my ai collaborators have indicated that even though it's "easy" to regurgitate the file from memory, it's more pleasant just to say "add this key" or "replace this section." The tool uses a tree-sitter ast to make safe and reliable syntax-aware editswithout having to deal with line/column offsets across subsequent edits. You'll need to provide the path to the file and a short unique snippet of text (anchor text) to "point" to a location in the file, and an ancestor node type to walk up to, and a "location" such as "before", "replace", "after", or "around". When using "around," it will place the existing ast node into the placeholder `{{content}}`. You don't need to be concerned with formatting at all, because it runs changes through a formatter (rustfmt for rust). You'll see a diff before the change is committed, and can retarget the selection if it isn't the intended change, or commit it to write to disk.

It's totally normal for there to be a learning curve in the first little bit of usage, but hopefully the tool provides polite, helpful, and actionable feedback to develop proficiency with it. Please let me know if at any point there are opportunies to improve the usability of the tool. In general, the ux principle I aspire to is "the user is never wrong."
