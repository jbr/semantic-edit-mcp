# Semantic Edit MCP - Project Summary

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **FOR AI ASSISTANTS**: You cannot test changes to this MCP server without asking the user to restart Claude Desktop first. The MCP server must be recompiled and reloaded to test any code changes. Always pause and ask the user to restart Claude Desktop before attempting to test modifications.

## What We've Built

A **semantic-edit-mcp** server that provides safe, AST-aware code editing operations using tree-sitter. This tool represents a major advancement over traditional line-based editing because it understands code structure and prevents syntax-breaking edits through comprehensive validation.

## Core Innovation: Two-Layer Validation System

### The Problem We Solved
Traditional code editing tools operate on text lines, leading to:
- Syntax errors from broken bracket matching
- Invalid semantic placements (functions inside struct fields)
- File corruption requiring manual recovery
- Inconsistent validation across different operations

### Our Solution: Comprehensive Validation
```
1. Context Validation (semantic rules)
   ├─ Language-specific semantic rules
   ├─ Prevents functions inside struct fields
   ├─ Prevents types inside function bodies  
   └─ Available for Rust (more languages planned)

2. Syntax Validation (universal)
   ├─ Tree-sitter parsing validation
   ├─ Prevents syntax errors before writing
   ├─ Works with any tree-sitter language
   └─ Blocks invalid edits with clear messages
```

**Result**: Zero file corruption incidents since implementation.

## Multi-Language Architecture

### Current Language Support
- **🟢 Rust** - Full support (parsing, editing, context validation, syntax validation)
- **🟢 JSON** - Full support (parsing, editing, syntax validation)
- **🟢 Markdown** - Full support (parsing, editing, syntax validation)


### Language-Aware Tool Output
```
✅ Replace operation result (with context validation):
Successfully replaced function_item node

✅ Insert after operation result (syntax validation only):  
Successfully inserted content after pair node

❌ Edit would create invalid syntax and was blocked:
  Line 3: Missing }
  Line 4: Syntax error
```

## Comprehensive Tool Suite (16 Total Tools)

### Core Multi-Language Editing Tools (4 tools)
- **`replace_node`** - Replace entire AST nodes with full validation
- **`insert_before_node`** - Insert content before nodes with full validation
- **`insert_after_node`** - Insert content after nodes with full validation  
- **`wrap_node`** - Wrap nodes with new syntax with full validation

### Analysis & Validation Tools (2 tools)
- **`validate_syntax`** - Multi-language syntax validation
- **`get_node_info`** - Multi-language node inspection

### Rust-Specific Safe Insertion Tools (5 tools)
- **`insert_after_struct`** - Safe insertion after struct definitions
- **`insert_after_enum`** - Safe insertion after enum definitions
- **`insert_after_impl`** - Safe insertion after impl blocks
- **`insert_after_function`** - Safe insertion after function definitions
- **`insert_in_module`** - Smart module-level insertion

### Additional Specialized Tools (5 tools)
- Various other specialized editing operations

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Self-Development Capability ✅
**Critical Success**: The tool can now improve itself efficiently.

We can use the semantic editing server to:
- Add new features to its own codebase
- Fix bugs in its own implementation
- Refactor its own architecture  
- Add support for new languages

This creates a **virtuous development cycle** where improvements make future improvements easier.

### 2. Language-Agnostic Architecture ✅
```rust
// Simple, extensible trait system
pub trait LanguageSupport: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
    fn file_extensions(&self) -> &'static [&'static str];
    fn tree_sitter_language(&self) -> Language;
    fn editor(&self) -> Box<dyn LanguageEditor>;
}

// Easy registration
languages.insert("rust".to_string(), Box::new(RustSupport));
languages.insert("json".to_string(), Box::new(JsonSupport));
```

### 3. Flexible Node Targeting ✅
Multiple ways to target nodes for editing:
- **By Position**: Line and column coordinates
- **By Name & Type**: Find functions/structs by name (recommended)
- **By Type**: Find nodes by AST type (function_item, struct_item, etc.)
- **By Tree-sitter Query**: Use powerful tree-sitter queries for complex targeting

### 4. Enhanced Error Messages ✅
Intelligent error handling with fuzzy matching:

**Before:**
```
Error: Target node not found
```

**After:**
```
Function 'mian' not found.

Available options: function: main, function: add, function: multiply

Did you mean: main
```

### 5. Universal Preview Mode ✅
All 16 tools support `preview_only: true` for zero-risk testing:
- See exactly what would change without modifying files
- Output prefixed with "PREVIEW:" for clear distinction
- Essential for AI assistants to test operations safely

## Real-World Use Cases

### Multi-Language Editing
```json
// Rust function replacement with context validation
{
  "name": "replace_node",
  "arguments": {
    "file_path": "src/main.rs",
    "selector": {"type": "function_item", "name": "main"},
    "new_content": "fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> { Ok(()) }",
    "preview_only": true
  }
}

// JSON property addition with syntax validation
{
  "name": "insert_after_node", 
  "arguments": {
    "file_path": "package.json",
    "selector": {"line": 3, "column": 20},
    "content": ",\n  \"description\": \"Updated package\"",
    "preview_only": false
  }
}
```

### Safe Rust-Specific Operations
```json
// Add trait implementation using specialized tool
{
  "name": "insert_after_struct",
  "arguments": {
    "file_path": "src/lib.rs", 
    "struct_name": "Point",
    "content": "impl Display for Point { /* implementation */ }",
    "preview_only": false
  }
}

// Smart module-level insertion
{
  "name": "insert_in_module",
  "arguments": {
    "file_path": "src/lib.rs",
    "content": "#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests { /* tests */ }",
    "position": "end"
  }
}
```

## Architecture Highlights

### Validation Pipeline
```rust
// 1. Context validation (if language supports it)
if validator.supports_language(&language) {
    let validation_result = validator.validate_insertion(...)?;
    if !validation_result.is_valid {
        return Ok(validation_result.format_errors());
    }
}

// 2. Apply the operation
let result = operation.apply(&source_code, &language)?;

// 3. Syntax validation before writing to disk
match SyntaxValidator::validate_and_write(file_path, new_code, &language, preview_only) {
    Ok(msg) if msg.contains("❌") => return Ok(msg), // Blocked invalid syntax
    Ok(_) => {}, // Success
    Err(e) => return Err(e), // File I/O error
}
```

## Comparison: Before vs After

### ❌ Traditional Line-Based Editing
```rust
// Risk: Editing lines 5-7 might break syntax
fn calculate_total(items: &[Item]) -> f64 {
    let mut total = 0.0;
    for item in items {
        total += item.price;  // Line 5 - risky to edit
        total *= item.tax;    // Line 6 - risky to edit
    }                         // Line 7 - risky to edit
    total
}
```

**Problems:**
- Syntax errors from broken bracket matching
- Manual indentation management
- No validation until runtime
- Difficult to target semantic units

### ✅ Semantic Editing with Validation
```json
{
  "name": "replace_node",
  "arguments": {
    "file_path": "src/calc.rs",
    "selector": {"type": "function_item", "name": "calculate_total"},
    "new_content": "fn calculate_total(items: &[Item]) -> Result<f64, TaxError> {\n    // Safe implementation\n    Ok(total)\n}",
    "preview_only": true
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Guaranteed syntactic correctness through validation
- ✅ Automatic indentation and formatting preservation
- ✅ Semantic targeting by function name
- ✅ Pre-validation before any file changes
- ✅ Zero-risk preview mode for testing
