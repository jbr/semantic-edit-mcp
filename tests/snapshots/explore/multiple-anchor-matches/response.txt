anchor_text `var` with ancestor_node_type `function_item` matches 2 nodes
Occurrences:
pub fn main() {\n    match std::env::var("x") ...

pub fn other() {\n    let my_var = "var";\n}

Suggestions: 
-> Use more specific anchor text to distinguish between matches
-> use the open_files tool if you have not yet done so
