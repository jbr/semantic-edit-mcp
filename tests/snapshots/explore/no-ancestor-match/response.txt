- Occurence 2: `Ok(var)`
   Available ancestors: identifier, tuple_struct_pattern, match_pattern, match_arm, match_block, match_expression, expression_statement, block, function_item, source_file
- Occurence 3: `("{}", var.to_ascii_uppercase())`
   Available ancestors: identifier, token_tree, macro_invocation, expression_statement, block, match_arm, match_block, match_expression, expression_statement, block, function_item, source_file
