Position-based targeting (line/column) is not allowed for edit operations.
Use semantic selectors instead:
â€¢ By name: {"name": "function_name"}
â€¢ By type: {"type": "function_item"}
â€¢ By query: {"query": "(function_item name: (identifier) @name)"}

ðŸ’¡ Use explore_ast or get_node_info with line/column to find the right semantic selector.
